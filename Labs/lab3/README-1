Copy of my program Lawn.java from pa1 into the lab3 directory.
Wrote a bash script called RunLawn that performs the following operations:

1. Print the line compiling Lawn.java to stdout.
2. Compile the program Lawn.java, sending any errors or warnings to the file Lawn-errs.
3. Print the line running Lawn.class to stdout.
4. Run the Java executable Lawn.class, reading input from a file called Lawn-in and sending output to
a file called Lawn-out.
5. Print the line deleting Lawn.class to stdout.
6. Remove the file Lawn.class from the current directory
