I found 7 errors:

1) 'books' should be 'book' instead of being plural.
2) 2 4 the out put says 'last weekend' instead of 'next weekend'.
3) When the modifier code is out of bounds in [5 4], it prints out "Thanks for the ERROR"
   it should say "Thanks for the ERROR you sent."
4) When an invalid number for the dollar is entered, the program crashes, and throws
   input.mismatch.exception when x< -2,147,483,647 and x > 2147,483,647.
5) When the sentence code is bigger than 5, ex.[7,2], it prints out: "7 is a valid sentence code."
   it should print out "7 is an invalid sentence code."
6) "Thanks for the stuff you sent " does not have a period at the end like it should.
7) "weather has been hot." should say "weather has been cold." [5 4]
