This repo is a collection of Labs for Programming in Java 
Author: A Davila

Brief Description of the labs in this repo:
  1. A simple Java program that prints OS Information to standard output
  2. A simple stdout program "Helllo, World", and description of the File System & Permissions in Unix
  3. Creates a Shell script <RunLawn.sh> to run the program <Lawn.java> redirecting input and output to files
  4. Creates an executable jar file containing a java program, automating compilation using Unix Makefiles
  5. Creates a letter automatically by encoding stock phrases as positive integers.
  6. Balckbox Testing program in Lab 5
  7. A C program <Sphere.c>, reads in 1 double value, then prints out the volume and surfacearea of the sphere
  8. A C program that emulates the GCD program (greatest common denominator)
  
  
There are 6 Programs (pa's):
  1. <Lawn.java> Java program that interact with the user by taking input from the keyboard, performing simple calculations
  2. <Guess.java> program that plays an interactive number guessing game with the user
  3. <GCD.java> Java program that prompts the user for two positive integers, then prints out the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. 
  4. <Roots.java> Java program that determines the real roots of a polynomial that lie within a specified range
  5. <Queens.java> Java program that finds all solutions to the n-Queens problem, Eight Queens Puzzle
  6. <Complex.java> Represents complex numbers as a pair of double values
